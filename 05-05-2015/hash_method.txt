Hash methods:

has_key? and has_value?

You can call these methods on a hash to see if certain keys or values exist in the hash.

If the hash does have the key or value, the method will return true. This could be useful for conditional statements or loops.

hash = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}

hash.has_value?(1) would return true
hash.has_key?(d) would return false
